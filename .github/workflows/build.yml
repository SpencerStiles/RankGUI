# NOTE: Automated builds are disabled because the Hytale Server API (libs/HytaleServer.jar)
# is not publicly available and too large for GitHub (80MB).
# 
# To release a new version:
# 1. Build locally: ./gradlew shadowJar
# 2. Create a GitHub release manually
# 3. Upload build/libs/RankGUI-x.x.x.jar to the release
#
# This workflow only runs on manual release creation to validate the release was created.
